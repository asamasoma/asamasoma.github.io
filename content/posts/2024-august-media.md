### Books

Dean Koontz, _The Bad Weather Friend_

Plato, _Apology._ Every New Year's, for nearly two decades now, I've made a resolution: I will finally read The Complete Works of Plato, a volume I purchased my freshman year in college, have started several times, and never finished. Here is where it always starts. But this time, I'm going to finish.

Plato, _Crito._

Arthur C. Clarke, _The Fountains of Paradise_

Harold Schechter, _Hell's Princess: The Mystery of Belle Gunness, Butcher of Men_

### Films

8/2 Krzysztof Zanussi, _The Structure of Crystal_ (1969): My introduction to this celebrated Polish director. An academically successful physicist visits his former classmate in the countryside, where he has abandoned a promising career to pursue domestic fulfillment. A meditation on the nature of success and what it means to live well. Dramatic structure demarcated by montages of academic literature and scientific diagrams.

8/3 Charlotte Gainsbourg, _Jane Par Charlotte_ (2021): Despite my interest in both subjects of this documentary, Charlotte Gainsbourg's directorial debut failed to capture my attention. Meant to feel intimate and perhaps "voyeuristic" (as Charlotte describes the imagined effect on visitors of the museum she is making out of the house she shared with her father), it instead comes off as self-absorbed and left this viewer feeling shut out.

8/4 Andrew Dominik, _One More Time With Feeling_ (2016): There are no words. I wish I'd seen this in 3D, although I suspect it is nearly as effective without it, anyway.

8/4 Krzysztof Zanussi, _Family Life_ (1971): Not quite as strong as his previous offering, this family melodrama differentiates itself with a black comedic turn towards Eastern Bloc Gothic horror at the end.

8/5 Krzysztof Zanussi, _Illumination_ (1973): A young physics student has a crisis of faith -- in science. A profound and emotionally wrenching investigation of mind as matter, matter as mind.

8/6 Krzysztof Zanussi, _Camouflage_ (1977): Doesn't quite reach the poetic heights of his earlier works, but perhaps that is by design. A slippery burlesque of the academic world, and by extension an interrogation of the possibility of ethics.

8/7 Krzysztof Zanussi, _The Constant Factor_ (1980): Zanussi returns again and again to mountain climbing as metaphor, this time in a quixotic tale of inflexible idealism amidst societal corruption. Scenes of mysterious emotional power.

8/7 Jesús Franco, _She Killed in Ecstasy_ (1971): Part of Weird Wednesdays at Alamo Drafthouse. One of the last films starring Soledad Miranda (of _Vampyros Lesbos_ fame) before her untimely demise.

8/8 Krzysztof Zanussi, _Life as a Fatal Sexually Transmitted Disease_ (2000)

8/8 Tilman Singer, _Cuckoo_ (2024)

8/11 Valentina Maurel, _I Have Electric Dreams_ (2022)

8/14 Derek Burbidge, _Urgh! A Music War_ (1980)

8/16 Amanda Kramer, _Please Baby Please_ (2022): Campy variations on a theme of the phantasmagoria of gendered desire. Jean Genet meets Tennessee Williams with costumes by Tom of Finland and the sensibility of Fassbinder.

8/17 William Crain, _Blacula_ (1972): William Marshall brings Shakespearean gravitas and operatic pathos to his starring role in this film about an 18th century African prince who, after being bitten by Count Dracula, is cursed to live with being a vampire in the 1970s Los Angeles, elevating to the level of grand tragedy what would otherwise be a campy blaxploitation version of Hammer horror.

8/18 Shawn Levy, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ (2024)

8/19 Yasuzô Masumura, _Irezumi_ (1966)

8/21 Melvin van Peebles, _Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song_ (1971): The arguably revolutionary film that arguably birthed the blaxploitation genre.

8/22 Yasuzô Masumura, _Red Angel_ (1966)

8/23 Margarethe von Trotta, _The German Sisters_ (1981)

8/28 Jerzy Skolimowski, _The Shout_ (1978)

8/29 Lucile Hadžihalilović, _Innocence_ (2004)

8/30 Don Hertzfeldt, _Me_ (2024) and _It's Such a Beautiful Day_ (2012)
